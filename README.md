# Parkinson's Disease Audio Analysis - Feature Based Approach

This project implements a feature-based approach for Parkinson's Disease detection using audio analysis. The pipeline includes audio organization, preprocessing, and feature extraction from voice recordings.

## Project Overview

This project processes voice recordings to distinguish between Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients and Healthy Controls (HC) using audio feature analysis. The pipeline consists of four main components:

1. **Audio Organization**: Organizes raw audio files from CSV metadata into cohort-based folders
2. **Audio Preprocessing**: Applies signal processing techniques to clean and standardize audio files
3. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts comprehensive acoustic features for machine learning analysis
4. **Filter-based Feature Selection**: Applies statistical methods to identify most discriminative features

## Features

### Audio Organization (`organize_audio_files.py`)

This script organizes raw WAV files into cohort-based folders (PD and HC) using CSV metadata as the source of truth.

Key behavior and purpose

- Read the CSV metadata (`all_audios_mapped_id_for_label/final_selected.csv`) which must include at least the columns `audio_audio.m4a` (the audio id) and `cohort` (label: `PD`, `HC`, etc.).
- Locate source audio folders under `Processed_data_sample_raw_voice/raw_wav/0/` and `Processed_data_sample_raw_voice/raw_wav/1/`. Each audio id should have a subfolder there containing a WAV file named like `audio_audio.m4a-<id>.wav`.
- Copy matched WAV file(s) into `data/PD/` or `data/HC/` depending on the cohort, and rename copied file(s) to `<audio_id>.wav` (e.g., `5398675.wav`).

Why it uses robocopy

- The script calls Windows `robocopy` via `subprocess.run` to copy files. `robocopy` is robust on Windows and handles long paths and large file sets better than plain Python file copies in some environments.
- The script treats a `robocopy` return code less than 8 as success (this is a standard robocopy convention).

Detailed step-by-step flow

1. Ensure destination base `data/` exists (script will create `data/PD` and `data/HC` if missing).
2. Load CSV using pandas: `pd.read_csv("all_audios_mapped_id_for_label/final_selected.csv")`.
3. Print cohort distribution and other basic stats.
4. Build a set of available audio-id folders by listing children of `Processed_data_sample_raw_voice/raw_wav/0/` and `/1/` (if these directories exist).
5. Iterate over CSV rows (progress printed every 1000 rows):
   - Convert `audio_audio.m4a` to string and read `cohort`.
   - Skip rows where `cohort` is not `PD` or `HC`.
   - Search for the audio-id folder under `raw_wav/0/<audio_id>` and `raw_wav/1/<audio_id>`.
   - If found, run `robocopy` specifying the source folder, destination cohort folder and file pattern `audio_audio.m4a-*.wav`.
   - On successful copy (robocopy code < 8), find the copied file in the destination, rename it to `<audio_id>.wav` and increment counters.
   - If not found or a copy error occurs, record the audio id and reason into an in-memory missing list.
6. After all rows: print a final summary, verify counts of files in the destination folders, and write `missing_files.csv` if there are missing items.

Inputs / outputs (contract)

- Inputs:
  - CSV: `all_audios_mapped_id_for_label/final_selected.csv` with columns `audio_audio.m4a` and `cohort`.
  - Source directories: `Processed_data_sample_raw_voice/raw_wav/0/<audio_id>/` and/or `.../1/<audio_id>/` containing files like `audio_audio.m4a-<id>.wav`.
- Outputs:
  - Organized files in `data/PD/` and `data/HC/` renamed to `<audio_id>.wav`.
  - `missing_files.csv` listing missing audio ids and reasons.

Prerequisites

- Windows OS (script uses `robocopy`).
- Python 3.x and pandas installed.

Install dependencies (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m pip install pandas
```

Run the script (PowerShell)

```powershell
python organize_audio_files.py
```

Quick verification (PowerShell)

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path .\data\PD -Filter "*.wav" | Measure-Object | Select-Object Count
Get-ChildItem -Path .\data\HC -Filter "*.wav" | Measure-Object | Select-Object Count
Import-Csv missing_files.csv | Measure-Object | Select-Object Count
```

Common edge-cases and troubleshooting

- If the CSV is missing required columns, the script will raise a KeyError when accessing `audio_audio.m4a` or `cohort`. Verify CSV headers before running.
- If source folders are not present under `raw_wav/0` or `raw_wav/1`, most files will be reported as missing. Check file layout and update the script or move files accordingly.
- If `robocopy` is unavailable or returns a code >= 8 (fatal), check permissions and run a single `robocopy` command manually to inspect output. For portability, consider replacing `robocopy` with Python `shutil.copy` (note: long path issues may resurface).
- Duplicate matching files: if multiple files match `audio_audio.m4a-*.wav` for a given id, the script picks the first match in the destination when renaming.

Suggestions and possible improvements

- Add CLI arguments for CSV path, source base, and destination base (argparse).
- Add a `--dry-run` mode that reports which files would be copied but does not execute copies.
- Add a cross-platform fallback to `shutil.copy` when not on Windows.
- Add logging to a file instead of printing, and add a verbose level.

Where to look in the code

- `organize_audio_files.py` contains the function `organize_audio_files()` which implements the complete flow and is executed when the script is run directly.

If you want, I can implement any of the suggested improvements or create a dedicated small README file just for this script; tell me which you prefer.

### Audio Preprocessing (`audio_preprocessing.py`)

This script applies signal processing techniques to clean and standardize audio files for consistent feature extraction. The preprocessing pipeline transforms raw audio files into high-quality, normalized voice segments optimized for acoustic analysis.

#### Core Objectives and Benefits

The preprocessing pipeline addresses several critical challenges in audio analysis:

1. **Sample Rate Standardization**: Converts all audio to 16 kHz for consistent temporal resolution
2. **Noise Reduction**: Removes low-frequency artifacts and background interference
3. **Voice Activity Detection**: Isolates speech segments from silence and non-speech audio
4. **Amplitude Normalization**: Ensures consistent signal levels across recordings
5. **Length Standardization**: Guarantees minimum duration for reliable feature extraction

#### Detailed Processing Pipeline

**Step 1: Audio Loading and Resampling**

- Loads audio using `librosa.load()` with target sample rate of 16 kHz
- 16 kHz provides optimal balance between quality and computational efficiency
- Sufficient bandwidth for speech analysis (speech content typically < 8 kHz)
- Reduces file size and processing time compared to higher sample rates

**Step 2: High-Pass Filtering**

- Applies 3rd-order Butterworth high-pass filter with 80 Hz cutoff
- Removes low-frequency noise, room rumble, and handling artifacts
- Preserves fundamental frequencies of human speech (typically 85-255 Hz for males, 165-265 Hz for females)
- Uses `scipy.signal.filtfilt()` for zero-phase filtering to avoid signal distortion

**Step 3: Silence Removal (Voice Activity Detection)**

- Frame-based analysis using 25ms windows with 10ms hop size
- Calculates RMS energy for each frame: `energy = mean(frame²)`
- Normalizes energy relative to maximum frame energy
- Threshold-based detection (default: 2% of maximum energy)
- Extracts and concatenates only voice-active segments
- Preserves temporal structure while removing silent regions

**Step 4: Amplitude Normalization**

- Scales audio to 90% of maximum amplitude range
- Formula: `normalized = (audio / max(|audio|)) × 0.9`
- Prevents clipping while maximizing dynamic range
- Ensures consistent signal levels across different recording conditions

**Step 5: Length Standardization**

- Ensures minimum duration of 0.5 seconds (8,000 samples at 16 kHz)
- Zero-pads shorter segments to meet minimum length requirement
- Prevents feature extraction errors on very short audio clips
- Maintains temporal consistency for statistical feature calculation

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Frame Analysis Parameters**

- **Frame Size**: 25ms (400 samples at 16 kHz)
- **Hop Size**: 10ms (160 samples) - 60% overlap for smooth analysis
- **Energy Calculation**: RMS energy per frame for robust voice detection
- **Threshold**: Adaptive based on signal energy distribution

**Filter Specifications**

- **Type**: Butterworth high-pass filter
- **Order**: 3rd order (18 dB/octave rolloff)
- **Cutoff**: 80 Hz (removes sub-vocal frequencies)
- **Implementation**: Zero-phase filtering using `filtfilt()`

**File Naming Convention**

- Input: Original audio IDs (e.g., `5398675.wav`)
- Output: Sequential naming `processed_0001.wav`, `processed_0002.wav`
- Avoids Windows long path issues while maintaining traceability

```

#### Signal Processing Theory and Rationale

**Why 16 kHz Sample Rate?**

- Nyquist theorem: 16 kHz captures frequencies up to 8 kHz
- Human speech content primarily below 4 kHz (formants typically 300-3500 Hz)
- Balances quality with computational efficiency
- Standard rate for speech processing applications

**Why 80 Hz High-Pass Filter?**

- Human vocal tract fundamental frequencies: 85-255 Hz (males), 165-265 Hz (females)
- Removes environmental noise, AC hum (50/60 Hz), and handling artifacts
- Preserves all speech-relevant frequency content
- 3rd-order filter provides steep rolloff without introducing artifacts

**Why Energy-Based Voice Activity Detection?**

- Simple, robust, and computationally efficient
- Effective for controlled recording environments
- Adapts to signal-specific energy distribution
- Preserves speech segments while removing silence and background noise

#### Common Issues and Troubleshooting

**Issue: "librosa not found" or import errors**

```powershell
# Install audio processing libraries
python -m pip install librosa soundfile
# On Windows, you may also need: pip install PySoundFile
```

**Issue: Very short output files**

- Check silence threshold (default: 0.02)
- Lower threshold for quiet recordings: modify `silence_threshold` parameter
- Verify input audio contains actual speech content

**Issue: Distorted or clipped audio**

- Check normalization factor (default: 0.9)
- Verify input audio quality and dynamic range
- Examine filter cutoff frequency for your specific audio characteristics

**Issue: Processing errors on specific files**

- Check file format compatibility (WAV, sample rate, bit depth)
- Verify file integrity using audio player
- Examine console error messages for specific failure modes

#### Performance Optimization

**For Large Datasets**

- Process files in batches to manage memory usage
- Use multiprocessing for parallel file processing
- Monitor disk I/O for bottlenecks

**Memory Management**

- Files processed individually to minimize memory footprint
- Temporary arrays cleared after each file
- Suitable for processing hundreds of files sequentially

#### Signal Quality Assessment

The preprocessing pipeline produces high-quality audio suitable for:

- Acoustic feature extraction (MFCC, spectral features)
- Voice quality analysis (jitter, shimmer, harmonics)
- Machine learning model training
- Clinical voice assessment applications

#### Integration with Pipeline

This preprocessing step is essential before feature extraction:

1. **organize_audio_files.py** → Organizes raw files by cohort
2. **audio_preprocessing.py** → Cleans and standardizes audio ✓
3. **feature_extraction.py** → Extracts acoustic features
4. **filter_feature_selection.py** → Selects discriminative features

  - Total frames: 298 (3 seconds at 10ms hop size)
  - Voice frames: 186 (frames above threshold)
  - Voice ratio: 0.62 (62% of signal contains speech)
- **Performance Assessment**: High accuracy in speech/silence classification

**Key Technical Observations from the Figure:**
1. **Perfect Segmentation**: Algorithm correctly identifies all three speech segments
2. **No False Positives**: Silence periods correctly classified as non-voice
3. **Sharp Transitions**: Clean on/off switching at speech boundaries
4. **Optimal Threshold**: 2% threshold effectively separates speech from silence
5. **Realistic Voice Ratio**: 62% voice activity typical for natural speech

**Clinical Validation Points:**
- **Robust Detection**: Works reliably across different speech intensity levels
- **Temporal Precision**: Preserves exact timing of speech events
- **Noise Immunity**: Low threshold prevents false triggering on background noise
- **Concatenation Effect**: Final processed audio will contain only the 1.8 seconds of speech

**Upper Panel - Original Signal with Speech Segments:**
- **Blue waveform**: Synthetic or real audio signal with alternating speech and silence
- **Green shaded regions**: Ground-truth speech segments for reference
- **X-axis**: Time in seconds (typically 0-3 seconds)
- **Y-axis**: Amplitude (-1 to +1 normalized range)
- **Signal characteristics**: Shows clear distinction between voice-active and silent periods

**Middle Panel - Frame Energy Analysis:**

- **Red dashed line**: Energy threshold (default: 0.02 or 2% of maximum energy)
- **Green filled area**: Frames classified as voice-active (above threshold)
- **Algorithm parameters**:
  - Frame size: 25ms (400 samples at 16 kHz)
  - Hop size: 10ms (160 samples) providing 60% overlap
  - Energy calculation: RMS energy per frame
- **Adaptive threshold**: Based on signal's own energy distribution

**Lower Panel - Voice Activity Detection Result:**

- **Green step function**: Binary VAD output (1 = voice, 0 = silence)
- **X-axis**: Time in seconds matching upper panels
- **Y-axis**: Voice activity (0 or 1)
- **Statistics box**: Contains key performance metrics:
  - Total frames analyzed
  - Number of voice-active frames detected
  - Voice activity ratio (percentage of signal containing speech)

**Algorithm Operation Details:**

**Frame-by-Frame Processing:**

1. **Windowing**: Signal divided into overlapping 25ms windows
2. **Energy Calculation**: RMS energy computed for each frame: `energy = sqrt(mean(frame²))`
3. **Normalization**: Energies scaled relative to maximum frame energy
4. **Threshold Application**: Frames with normalized energy > 0.02 classified as voice
5. **Segment Extraction**: Voice-active frames concatenated to form clean speech signal

**Threshold Selection Rationale:**

- **2% threshold**: Balances sensitivity vs. noise rejection
- **Adaptive nature**: Threshold relative to signal's own energy distribution
- **Robustness**: Works across different recording conditions and signal levels
- **Conservative approach**: Prefers including borderline frames over excluding speech

**Performance Indicators:**

- **High voice ratio**: Indicates presence of substantial speech content
- **Low voice ratio**: May suggest very quiet recording or excessive silence
- **Typical values**: 0.3-0.7 for normal speech recordings
- **Quality assessment**: Voice ratio helps validate recording quality

**Visual Validation:**

- **Alignment check**: Green regions in energy panel should align with speech in waveform
- **Threshold appropriateness**: Red threshold line should separate speech from noise/silence
