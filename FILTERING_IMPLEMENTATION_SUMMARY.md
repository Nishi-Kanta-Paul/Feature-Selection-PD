- **Conservative Filter**: 2.5th-97.5th percentile range (1104.1-3323.3 Hz) 
- **Voice Optimized Filter**: Voice-optimized range (139.9-2963.9 Hz)

### 2. Dataset Analysis Results

From your dataset analysis (21 files: 2 PD + 19 HC):
- **Total files analyzed**: 21
- **Frequency analysis complete**: ‚úÖ
- **Filter parameters calculated**: ‚úÖ

#### **Calculated Filter Parameters:**
```
Conservative Filter: 2.5th-97.5th percentile range: 1104.1-3323.3 Hz
Voice Optimized Filter: Voice-optimized range: 139.9-2963.9 Hz
Broad Filter: 1st-99th percentile range: 1083.6-3539.0 Hz
```

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### **High-Pass Filter**
- **Purpose**: Removes low-frequency noise below the calculated cutoff

- **Success rate**: 100% (no processing failures)
- **Features per sample**: 139
- **Filter types tested**: 3 (conservative, voice_optimized, broad)

### **Filter Effectiveness:**
The significant differences in extracted features between filter types demonstrate that:
1. **Filtering is working**: Large differences in spectral features show effective frequency band selection
2. **Noise reduction**: Lower RMS energy indicates successful noise filtering
3. **Feature preservation**: F0 values remain in physiological ranges, indicating voice characteristics are preserved
